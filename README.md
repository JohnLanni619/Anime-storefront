## Fast Followers
In the future there are several features that would improve overall user experience while driving sales forward. 
- cart checkout feature utlilizing payment options such as klarna, afterpay, or paypal (this will be covered in Module 22 with React)
- forum for users to connect
- redirect/modal for leaving page or cart
- {{#if loggedIn}} helper fix that will remove login button at user authentication - previous tests of this feature didn't carry over to pages outside of main.handlebars
